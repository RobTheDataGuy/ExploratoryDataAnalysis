# ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Repository to house all code regarding exploratory data analysis

In this repository, I will post all of my Python code used for common exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks.

First, I will gather data from Kaggle.com using the Kaggle API. Then I will perform some EDA to gather insights into the dataset.
From there, I'll add notes and answer some questions in the code. 

Overall, this will serve as a notebook of sorts for me, or anyone, to reference while performing EDA.

Cheers!
